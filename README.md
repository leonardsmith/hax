A hex color code is a 6-symbol code made of up to three 2-symbol elements. Each of the 2-symbol elements expresses a color value from 0 to 255. The code is written using a formula that turns each value into a unique 2-digit alphanumeric code. For example, the RGB code (224, 105, 16) is E06910 in hexadecimal code.
